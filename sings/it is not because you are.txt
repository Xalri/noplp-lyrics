 When I have rencontred you
 You was a jeune fille au pair
 And I put a spell on you
 And you roule a pelle to me
 
 Together we go partout
 On my mob it was super
 It was friday on my mind
 It was a story d'amour
 
 It is not because you are
 I love you because I do
 C'est pas parc' que you are me
 Qu'I am you qu'I am you
 
 You was really beautiful
 In the middle of the foule
 Don't let me misunderstood
 Don't let me sinon I boude
 #My loving, my marshmallow
 
 #You are belle and I are beau
 #You give me all what you have
 #I say thank you, you are bien brave
 #It is not because you are
 
 #I love you because I do
 #C'est pas parc'que you are me qu'I am you
 #I wanted marry with you
 #And make love very beaucoup
 
 #To have a max of children
 #Just like Stone and Charden
 #But one day that must arrive
 #Together we disputed
 
 #For a stupid story of fric
 #We decide to divorced
 #It is not because you are
 #I love you because I do
 
 #C'est pas parc' que you are me qu'I am you
 #You chialed comme une madeleine
 #Not me, I have my dignit
 #You tell me: you are a sale mec
 
 #I tell you: poil to the bec
 #That's comme ça that you thank me
 #To have learning you english
 #Eh! That's not you qui m'a appris
 
 #My grand father was rosbeef!
 #It is not because you are
 #I love you because I do
 #C'est pas parc' que you are me qu'I am you
