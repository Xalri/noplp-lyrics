 I need somebody
 Help 
 Not just anybody
 Help  
 You know I need someone
 Help 
 
 When I was younger so much younger 
 Than today
 I never needed anybody's help in any way
 But now these days are gone
 I'm not so self assured 
 Now I find I've changed my mind 
 And opened up the doors
 Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
 And I do appreciate you being round
 Help me get my feet back on the ground
 #Won't you please
 #Please help me
 #Help me help me
 #Oh
